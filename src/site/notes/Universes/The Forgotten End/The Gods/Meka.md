Meka is an unique "God", as he is an [[_misc or referenceables/GodTeirs/Ascended\|Ascended]], meaning he was once mortal.

He is classified as an [[_misc or referenceables/GodTeirs/Domain\|Domain]] of Order, Artificiality, and Balance to those who are unaware of his origins. 
This is the only place this next part has been written or outright said. Meka *is* [[Universes/The Forgotten End/Mekrath\|Mekrath]]. 

The story of Meka and Mekrath is one of complicated time travel, parallel realities, and paradoxes. 
To put it shortly, Meka is the *first* iteration of Mekrath in the Multiverse, who had lost his memories at the end of his mortal days so that he could take up the mantle he now holds.

The Original Timeline, he was an simple mechanic in a world with barely a flicker of magic, the end was a cold lifeless void and the endurian race *barely* were staying alive. He was born into a golden age, literally. The miners of the End had discovered a vein of silicon, gold, enderite and levitite. 

He was known for being adaptable in the face of ever changing odds, even rumored to have been blessed by the Twin Gods, [[Universes/The Forgotten End/The Gods/Vivian\|Vivian]], and [[Universes/The Forgotten End/The Gods/Void\|Void]]. 

How right those rumors were, in the beginning he was chosen to be the High Priest of Balance, a role that held alot of responsibility and was the sole voice between right and wrong. However as the years past people began to notice, he wasnt aging. He stayed the High Priest of Balance for a a *long* time, thousands of years even.

When [[Universes/The Forgotten End/The Collapse/The First Collapse\|The First Collapse]] happened, it was He who saved everything.

He stood at the point where reality collapsed in onto itself, and grabbed the Weave, and shaped it, forcing his Enduring Soul into its very existence. Restarting reality as he knew it.
