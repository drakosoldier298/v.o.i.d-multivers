- # The Elytarian Shulk War
    - The Start
	    - The war was started due to a discourse between an Elytarian noble and his harsh laws on a shulk city. The shulk stood up for themself and killed the nobleman and all of his subordinates. 
    - The Type of Battle
	    - It was a mobile war in which the shulks constructed large ships capable of floating through the void itself to get around. They mastered the use of their projectiles to make them into cannons and would sail through the void hunting down elytarians.
    - The shulks began taking trophies, these trophies were the wings of elytarians and they would be proudly placed in the ships in which the shulks flew.
    
- The Endarians
    - Didn’t join the war until later on. They fought on the sides of the elytarians seeing what the shulks were doing as evil and wrong. To aid them in battle the endarians prayed to the void itself and created a being of pure anger and hatred. The Ender Dragon
    - The Ender Dragon ended the war quickly due to its harsh rule of the end causing it to fall into disarray as they were put under harsh punishment.
#  The Ender Dragon.
- Personality
    - Was harsh and egotistical. It believed it was the form of all righteousness as that was what it was built for. However, the way it carried out its duties was less civil.
-  Crimes
    - The dragon closed off all forms of exiting the end. She destroyed all of the end islands within 1000 blocks of the main island and closed the portal to the overworld. She kept her most devoted enderman with her on the main island and banished the rest to camps out in the end islands forever enslaved.

- Death
    - One day 20 years ago a sole group of hunters entered the end. These hunters were trained veterans tasked with going to the end and finding out why all contact was lost.
	- The warriors fought long and hard against the dragon eventually they were able to cut it down and as the dragon’s body disintegrated its skin and body slowly dripped down into the portal basin filling it up opening the end once again.
    

- # The Bridge
    - With the death of the ender dragon shulks, endarians and elytarians flocked to the portal to leave the end. It was a flock of people all arriving in the land of (main city). Throughout the next 20 years, people from the end would arrive from the end however no one ever entered the dimension, the whereabouts of the end portal being lost to man.   
    

- # Myth
    - While the enderians, shulks and elytrians swear they came from the end, most don’t remember and the thought of the end dimension has become mostly a myth, A story told to the kids as a fairytale to help them sleep.
