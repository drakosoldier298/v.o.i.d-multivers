an extremely early creature concept with heavy inspiration from an old minecraft roleplay called [The Haunting](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMIih0GGEVFwGvm4Nos5D87nx21QO0whn) There are 2 subvariants for these that will be described here.

# Normal nightmares

These creatures are created when someone accidently or purposefully destroys their universe and end up in the [[Universes/External/Void/In-Between\|In-Between]] Where they are torn apart atom by atom and put back together eventually being put back together incorrectly having new limbs or missing limbs and features.
## looks
- Looks of this species varies but follow this general description.
- Dark void like skin.
- bright white or pink eyes most of the time without pupils but still showing a look of fear or panic.
- never looking like the original species, most of the time incomprehensible from the original.
- multiple limbs that the original creature wouldnt have had,
- anywhere from 1 to 10 feet tall.
