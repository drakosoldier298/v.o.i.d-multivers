### The quick explanation

It is a cult that follows the Visualization Of Infinite Destinies or, V.O.I.D and are the few beings to be given the ability to travel freely between universes without breaking the fabric of reality.

A way for the writers to give in lore reasons for a story being drastically changed.

# Origins

This human met V.O.I.D and was granted the ability to see other universes and the ability to spread the portal knowledge.
