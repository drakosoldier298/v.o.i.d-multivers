This is the first concept of a dimension and is what i referred to as the void for the longest time.

## Looks

- An seemingly infinite space
- No visible light
- Beams of light periodically appearing and disappearing around the dimensions.
- Small Medium and Large creatures known as [[Universes/External/Creature/Nightmare's\|Nightmare's]] can be seen appearing and disappearing, Wandering, and being torn apart.
- occasionally you can see a person, be it human ,alien, orc, or anything, appear, scream and vanish, only for a them to appear again somewhere else, if observed eventually the person will start appearing with oddities like extra eyes, missing eyes, extra limbs missing limbs.
## Mechanics
- infinite void
- beams of light appearing randomly, and can be seen striking the [[Universes/External/Creature/Nightmare's\|Nightmare's]] These pillars of light are new universes being created and dying out.
