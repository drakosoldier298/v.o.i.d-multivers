## Looks

- A seemingly infinite space of palm and oak trees with some cactus without thorns.
- Many animals can be seen here, like cows, crows, pidgeons pigs, and other basic animals, All animals are non-hostile and infact are very friendly.
- pools of clean drinking water can be found here, even though most people who end up here find they no longer need to eat or drink.

## Mechanics

idk why im calling this section mechanics but i cant think of any other thing to describe this.

- A safe place where one cannot die, not from age hunger or thirst, Not even self inflicted injuries will kill or even hurt, They will not heal however.
- People do not age here
