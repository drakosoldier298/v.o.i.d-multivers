# Overview

The Crypto-sphere is a Universe that is one giant city, that can attach itself to other universesallowing passage and trade between itself and the external universe.


# Districts

Each part of the city counts as its own District
##  District 0 
 The center of the city, it houses many of the large companies 
##### Companies
 - NA
 - NA

## District 1
Mostly shops and restaurants, be it modern Japanese, Or ancient Chinese dishes, Orcish, Elven, You can find just about any species and any era here

## District 2
This District is the rich housing district, Filled with mansions and towering Casino/Hotels. 

Looking to spend money? 
looking to maybe make it big? 
This is the place to be, there isn't a currency you cant use.

## District 3
This is the poor housing district, 
Tightly packed suburbs with barely any room between some buildings
Homeless littering the streets in some places.

## District 4
The outskirts. This is where the criminals and gangs normally are, You need someone dead? Need information? You can get it here for a price.

There's is a chunk of this district heavily protected where the crypto sphere bridges with other universes.
# UNDER CONSTRUCTION
######  currently this entire note is being rewritten.


the crypto sphere is a city forged under the rule of whoever has the most power is high class, the city is forged under 4 zones.

## The High District,

The Number one rule here is whoever The most powerfull people are live here, Their words are final. You can expect most high end businesses to be operating here, one of them being who is the top of the top there.

## 2nd zone

the mid zone it's a zone that is for people who aren't poor but not rich ether (mostly a common city type vibe)

## The third zone. the low end,

it is a place where crime happens alot and it's one rule is survival of the fittest and it is pretty common to just see a dead person laying on the street cuz they were stabbed or shot

## lastly is the outter void,

A place that is a barren wasteland save for the few who choose to go out here, Mountainous and a few deserts, This is where you would find the veil between void's easiest broken.

## Operation

the cryptosphere itself is a ball of energy that connects itself to any universe that has electricity/wifi, The universe having electricity and or wifi allows citizens of the crypto, However it is illegal to travel outside the Cryptosphere, Unless you are not from the Cryptosphere

This rule is broken constantly by outlaw's
