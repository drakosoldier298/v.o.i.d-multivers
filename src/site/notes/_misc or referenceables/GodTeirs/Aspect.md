These gods are *mortal*, and Typically  have an Origin or Domain either fully or partially responsible for their creation
Their power cannot be equal to, or greater than their Progenitor's power. 
With a Domain of Water as their progenitor, an Aspect could control anywhere from a glass of water, or the moisture in the sky.
Technically speaking with knowledge Aspects can become more powerful in the refined use of their powers.
