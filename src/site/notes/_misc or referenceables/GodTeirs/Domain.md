These gods are not as immutable as Origin gods, but hold the same roles. They can exist without a Reality to bind them, just as much as reality can carry on existing *without* them. 
Their power level is similarly as absolute over their "domain" as a Origin's god is. however they get to have a little more play with how it works.
A Domain of "Water" has Absolute power over what is considered to be "water", while having control over ice and steam
Power is "flexible" but has an upper limit
