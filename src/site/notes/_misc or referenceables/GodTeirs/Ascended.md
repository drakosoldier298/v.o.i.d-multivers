These are *not* Gods in the sense as we know them. The Ascended are by definition, "Any singular entity with the capacity to grow their power without limits".
The Ascended term is used to refer to those who have broken their upper limiters, a good example of this would be Saitama. However there is one Entity in the VOID multiverse that is Ascended, and is crucial in alot of lore.
