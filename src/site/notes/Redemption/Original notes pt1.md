Nature (the art whereby God hath made and governs the world) is by the art of man, as in many other things, so in this also imitated, that it can make an artificial animal. For seeing life is but a motion of limbs, the beginning whereof is in some principle part within, why may we not say that all automata (engines that move themselves with springs and wheels as doth a watch) have artificial life?

“Black Box”

  

The conceptualization of a shadowed box. The world is found within the blackened box, the surrounding, one way glass. The gods look in, but humanity cannot look out. 

  

Humanity stands behind the Black Box, hidden from the eyes of the “gods”, so they send a mortal form of themselves down in order to find the issue, but in the process cannot contact their higher self once within the box and find themselves stuck within it
