The original ideas for the story was to have a world Where the gods fell from grace due to unknown means and were forced to live among the mortal world as they had lost access to the divine realm.  

The players of this would be Normal players, and then the "gods" which were admins and moderators.  
The gods would get the choice of revealing themselves as the gods to the players or stay hidden

The ones who choose to reveal themself were to tell players of what transpired and allow the players to decide if they want to beleive and help the gods return to the divine realm or harm them to try and take their godhood.
