- Normally wearing a hoodie or coat, and a white turtleneck, black jeans, IS always carrying a book bag filled with papers and books, one book gleaming with an enchantment that binds the book to his soul, guarantees that it goes with him between worlds.

## Abilities

- That of an enderman such as
- Teleportation, up to 50 meters and instant, Can and will activate on danger sense, if his body thinks he is in immediate danger he will teleport away in a random direction.
- True sight(limited), He can see through invisibility closer than 3 meters
- Dimension traveler (curse) Caused by a malfunctioning spell, He can teleport between dimensions against his will, this can happen anywhere from 1 day to 200 years.

## Species

Many would think he is half human half enderman due to the very similiar abilities. However in reality he is human with a curse slowly turning him into part [[Universes/External/Creature/Nightmare's\|Nightmare's]]

This was not the original case when writing his character however not long after his creation and world expansion this was the outcome.

## Origins

Ok to preface this, the origins for this character ahs changed like 12 times so i dont know if what im gonna write will be cohesive across every story.

As a child he grew up in poverty, family only able to afford just enough food to feed him and his siblings, His parents were neglectful btu fulfilled everything required of them, At age 13 He chose to start researching magic, He learned how to create fire to keep the family warm in the winter and grow crops without fertilizer, 

He couldnt profit off this so around age 15 he left his family in search of what people called "[[Universes/External/The end\|The end]]" a dimension of infinite riches, the way to get to it was lost to time, He spent a few years researching dimensional teleportation and gathering the materials required, 

Finally at age 18 he manages to actually make it to The end, But it was a one way trip, He was stuck there for years learning from the native creatures what to eat and how to live since there was no light his skin grew pale and his hair lightened. 

At age 23 he managed to gather materials for another Dimensional teleportation spell. But he set it up wrong, instead of a one time spell to his home dimension he set a Universal travel spell and accidently looped the spell, Causing a rift to open and stay open tearing that universe apart.
